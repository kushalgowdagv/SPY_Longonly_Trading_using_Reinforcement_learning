### SPY_Longonly_Trading_using_Reinforcement_learning



#### Project Overview

This repository contains a project focused on Reinforcement Learning for financial market trading. The system operates with:

- **Action**: Whether to buy or sell a stock.
- **Reward**: Profit or loss obtained from the previous trade.
- **State**: Market conditions represented by price and indicator values.

The project uses various machine learning tools and libraries to train an agent that learns optimal trading strategies based on historical market data.

#### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required libraries (install via `pip`):
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `gymnasium`
  - `stable-baselines3`
  - `ta` (Technical Analysis library)
  - `pyfolio`
  - `seaborn`

---

#### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Reinstall specific versions of certain packages:
   ```bash
   pip install 'stable-baselines3==1.7.0' --force-reinstall
   ```

---

#### Project Structure

- **main.ipynb**: Contains the code for training and evaluating the reinforcement learning models.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`: Data processing and analysis.
  - `ta`: Compute technical indicators for financial data.
  - `gymnasium`: Framework for defining and training custom environments.
  - `stable-baselines3`: Prebuilt RL algorithms like A2C, PPO, and DDPG.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization libraries.
  - `pyfolio`: Portfolio performance evaluation.

---

#### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the cells to:
   - Preprocess data
   - Define custom trading environments
   - Train the RL model using algorithms like PPO or DDPG
   - Visualize performance metrics and results

3. Evaluate the agent's performance based on profit and loss metrics.

#### Troubleshooting

- If installation errors occur for specific libraries (e.g., `stable-baselines3`), refer to the official documentation for additional setup instructions.
- Restart the kernel in Jupyter Notebook if imports fail after installing packages.
